cowsay is a configurable talking cow, originally written in Perl by [Tony Monroe](https://github.com/tnalpgge/rank-amateur-cowsay)

This project is a translation in JavaScript of the original program and an attempt to bring the same silliness to node.js.

## Install

    npm install -g cowsay

## Usage

    cowsay JavaScript FTW!

or

    cowthink node.js is cool

It acts in the same way as the original cowsay, so consult `cowsay(1)` or run `cowsay -h`

## Configuration

If you have directory of own cows files, then you can include them to `cowsay` changing environment variable `COWSAY_DIR` (NOTE that in this case default cows files will be ignored, so suggest copy them to your directory).  String stored in variable `COWSAY_DIR` must be path to directory containing `.cows` files, you can receive a lot of `.cows` files, for example, in a cows files GitHub repository (for example this [repo](https://github.com/tnalpgge/rank-amateur-cowsay "GitHub repository containing defnition of cows"))

## Usage as a module

cowsay can be used as any other npm dependency
```js
var cowsay = require("cowsay");

console.log(cowsay.say({
    text : "I'm a moooodule",
    e : "oO",
    T : "U "
}));

// or cowsay.think()
```

getting a list of cow names:
```js
function get_cows(error, cow_names) {
    if (error) {
        console.log(error)
    }
    else if (cow_names) {
        console.log(`Number of cows available: ${cow_names.length}`);
    }
}

cowsay.list(get_cows);
```

#### Typescript examples:
```ts
import * as cowsay from "cowsay"

let output: string = cowsay.say({ text: 'Hello from typescript!' });

console.log(output);
```

getting a list of cow names:
```ts
function get_cows(error: NodeJS.ErrnoException, cow_names: Array<string>): void {
    if (error) {
        console.log(`Error getting cow names: ${error.message}`)
    }
    else if (cow_names) {
        console.log(`Number of cows available: ${cow_names.length}`);
    }
}

cowsay.list(get_cows);
```

importing the `IOptions` interface directly:
```ts
import { IOptions } from "cowsay" // optional

let opts: IOptions = {
    text: "Hello from TypeScript!",
    e: '^^',
    r: true,
};

console.log(cowsay.say(opts));
```


## Pipe from standard input

    echo please repeat | cowsay

## Usage in the browser

cowsay works in your browser too with rollup / webpack / browserify / you name it.

```js
import { say } from 'cowsay';

console.log(say({ text: 'grazing in the browser' }));
```

You can customize the cow by importing the relevant one

```js
import { think, SQUIRREL } from 'cowsay';

console.log(think({
  text: 'grazing in the browser',
  cow: SQUIRREL,
  eyes: 'pp',
  tongue: ';;',
}));
```

All cows are included in the bundle, but you can use rollup / webpack tree-shake feature to reduce the final bundle size.

### Browser options

```js
say({
  text: 'hello',
  cow: '', // Template for a cow, get inspiration from `./cows`
  eyes: 'oo', // Select the appearance of the cow's eyes, equivalent to cowsay -e
  tongue: 'L|', // The tongue is configurable similarly to the eyes through -T and tongue_string, equivalent to cowsay -T
  wrap: false, // If it is specified, the given message will not be word-wrapped. equivalent to cowsay -n
  wrapLength: 40, // Specifies roughly where the message should be wrapped. equivalent to cowsay -W
  mode: 'b', // One of 	"b", "d", "g", "p", "s", "t", "w", "y"
});
```
